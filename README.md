# mush

Monke Ultimate SHell <br/>

The ultimate shell for monkes.

Features:

* [x] Executing commands <br>
* [x] Built-in commands <br>
    * [x] cd <br>
    * [x] help <br>
    * [x] exit <br>
* [ ] Language and interpreter <br>
* [ ] Support for script files <br>
* [ ] Support for config fles <br>
* [ ] History file with up arrow support <br>

(I'll try to add these missing features swiftly)

Sense mush is currently lacking, if you wish to use it, I recommend appending it to your .bashrc file or any other method that does not actually change your shell
but runs the mush executable.
